# Deep-Bioreactor-Modelling

This app allows bioreactor operators to determine their feedstock characteristics from reading only process sensors,
letting them set up their physical models to optimize their process control with ease.
The deep-models were trained on an [ASM1 model implementation of the Technical University of Denmark](https://github.com/wwtmodels/Activated-Sludge-Models) by the 
that was modified by us to simulate only one aerobic batch bioreactor instead of a full waste-water-management plant.

The models presented here predict the following variables:

1. 
2.
3.
4.
5.

The models use only time-series of the first-day (15 minute intervals) of the following sensor data:

1. Dissolved Oxygen Concentration
2. Ammonia-Ion Concentration
3. Nitrate-Ion Concentration
4. H+-Ion Concentration ( $10^-pH$ )
